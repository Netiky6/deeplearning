### RAPIDS.AI Dataloader Repo
This repository is the home of dataloaders developed to help provide connectivity between RAPIDS cuDF dataframes and the different deep learning libraries available.  Functionality will be added as it becomes available.

Each deep learning library is contained within it's own subfolder, with the different dataloader options and examples contained within further subfolders.  For now our focus is on PyTorch, however we expect to add other libraries in the future.
